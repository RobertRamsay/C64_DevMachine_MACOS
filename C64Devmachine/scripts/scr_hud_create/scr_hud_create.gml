/// @function scr_hud_create(_asset)
/// @desc Seeds the meta for a fresh HUD asset. Every field the editor or the
///       compile chain touches is initialised here, so neither has to test for
///       a missing member at runtime.
///
/// A HUD is a RECTANGLE OF SCREEN — a char grid plus a colour grid covering
/// cells (hud_x, hud_y) to (hud_x + hud_w - 1, hud_y + hud_h - 1) of the 40x25
/// text screen. That is what a status panel actually is on a C64: a block of
/// screen RAM and matching colour RAM that the game stamps down once and then
/// pokes individual cells of as the score, lives or keys change.
///
/// MACRO_HUD emits the two grids inline, plus a <key>_draw entry point that
/// stamps them into screen/colour RAM, plus one entry point per FIELD.
///
/// FIELDS are the cells the game writes at runtime:
///   kind 0 TEXT   — position only. No code emitted; the label is there so a
///                   code block can find the cell without counting rows.
///   kind 1 DIGITS — <key>_<name> takes a value 0-255 in A and writes it as
///                   decimal digits, right-aligned across the field.
///   kind 2 BAR    — <key>_<name> takes a count in A and fills that many cells
///                   with `full`, the rest with `empty` (lives, energy, ammo).
///
/// The asset carries no address of its own: the data is emitted by the node,
/// on the spine, jumped over — the same arrangement MACRO_SID_SONG uses for a
/// MUSIC_MAKER asset.
