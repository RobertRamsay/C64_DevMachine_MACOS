/// ====================================================================
/// ORG BLOCK COLLAPSE
///
/// An ORG node (VARS and HW REGISTERS included — they are ORG-typed) gets a
/// [-] / [+] tab just above its header. Folding it hides every node that names
/// it as org_parent.
///
/// WHY IT DOES NOT TOUCH height
/// ----------------------------
/// The obvious implementation is to set each child's height to 0 and remember
/// the old value. That does not survive contact with this codebase: height is
/// DERIVED, not stored. obj_c64_node's Draw event recomputes it from node_type
/// on every height_dirty, and a dozen unrelated things raise that flag — an
/// edit, a mode switch, a picker closing. A collapsed child would spring back
/// to full size the moment any of them fired, mid-fold.
///
/// So height is left alone and the fold lives in one flag on the PARENT. The
/// layout pass gives a hidden child an effective height of zero without
/// altering the real one, which also means there is nothing to cache and
/// nothing to restore: expanding is a single boolean.
///
/// COLLAPSE IS PURELY VISUAL
/// -------------------------
/// Addresses come from total_node_size, not from y. The child loop in
/// scr_c64_do_update_addresses accumulates _chain_pc separately from _child_y,
/// so folding moves nodes on the canvas and changes nothing about the program.
/// A folded block builds byte-for-byte identical to an open one.
